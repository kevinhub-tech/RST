### About the Project
The content is in the title itself that the project explicits about the risks that may undergo in the process of making a website. In this project, we were given a scanerio and a requirement to make a risk-based strategy of our own to solve the revelant risks. The scanerio was - 

- Develop a risk-based strategy for a Car portal where use can surf around the internet for car sales
- Clearly demonstrate how this strategy will solve the problems that will be experienced during implementation
- Create a Car-Portal to test with developed risk-based strategy plan.

This was an individual project and this was assembled in the time period of a month.

### Languages and Tools applied

- Eclipse IDE
- PhpMyAdmin
- Spring MVC

### What I have done

There were loads of studying that I have to invest about risks test model and different types of risks as there are plenty. And thankfully, the module provided enough materials to learn about the model in a precise detail. Thus, these are the things that I have undertaken for the project.

- Obtained wide range of knowledge about different type of risks
- Generated my own customized RBT(risk-based testing) model with objectives to complete
- Assembled a car portal with Spring MVC framework
- Managed a database system for the portal
- Aligned the testing model with the portal and solved the resulted risks


### Accomplishments

Throughout the whole module, it was overwhelming to achieve such milestones for the project and I was pleased that the risk-based testing model that I have invented worked really well to sort things out for the portal. Firstly, RBT (risk-bassed testing) model was completed and it was executed as well to figure that it would solve some potholes in the portal. Secondly, the modificatin for the portal was completed due to the plan and every available testing were executed for that matter. The **source code** that is visible on the file on github was the portal codes and here is the portal that was integrated with the RBT model.
