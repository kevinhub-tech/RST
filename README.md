### About the Project
The content is in the title itself that the project explicits about the risks that may undergo in the process of making a website. In this project, we were given a scanerio and a requirement to make a risk-based strategy of our own to solve the revelant risks. The scanerio was - 

- Develop a risk-based strategy for a Car portal where use can surf around the internet for car sales
- Clearly demonstrate how this strategy will solve the problems that will be experienced during implementation
- Create a Car-Portal to test with developed risk-based strategy plan.

This was an individual project and this was assembled in the time period of a month.

### Languages and Tools applied

- Eclipse IDE
- PhpMyAdmin
- Spring MVC

### What I have Done

There were loads of studying that I have to invest about risks test model and different types of risks as there are plenty. And thankfully, the module provided enough materials to learn about the model in a precise detail. Thus, these are the things that I have undertaken for the project.

- Obtained wide range of knowledge about different type of risks
- Generated my own customized RBT(risk-based testing) model with objectives to complete
- Assembled a car portal with Spring MVC framework
- Managed a database system
